This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Sprint 3 - evaluación final

In this project you can:

### 🔎 Search a character of Harry Potter's World 🔎

In this page you can search the film character you most like in the field above by its name.

### 📋 Character list and Character Details 📋

First, you can see there's a landing page with the search field and a list of 25 characters of this film.

If you search the name you are looking for or some letters the filter will show you the characters with that name or letters. So, after that, you can click the character you want and a card detail will appear on the screen with some info about.
